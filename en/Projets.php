			Description : </h5>
		<p>	In this project, we aim at conceiving a joystick glove to enhance the chair's
		manoeuvreability while keeping an affordable selling price for the client. Indeed,
		we do consider that every person should be able to play powerchair football, even 
		among the heavily disabled. Nevertheless, suited chairs are only US and German 
		manufactured, hence their expensive price. In addition, they are often provided 
		with a bulky joystick which, in most cases, is not convenient to use.<br/>
			Our contribution to this long-term project will lie in rethinking the control joystick.
		The stake is to include the joystick within a glove that shall allow disabled people to 
		use it – the user's hand must stick to the glove – while remaining in a safe position. 
		The purpose- will be manufacturing a working prototype by the end of the year.
